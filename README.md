      * File Name Hash
    * Archive CRC Value
    * Archive Revision
  * Index CRC Value
  * Index Version

  * Batch render all music and jingles to the cache output folder
  * Shuffle songs from folder or cache where possible
  * Ability to override the instruments with a SoundFont 2 file of choice, using the original instrument configurations.
* Music port tool for utilizing the RuneScape sounds in music producing applications such as Cubase, etc. (MIDI Port must contain "port" in its name)
* Xtea Keys Tool, to decode encrypted map files - The relevant archive/file must be selected in the explorer while using the tool.
* Model Converter - New to Old, converts the RuneScape High Definition era models to older RuneScape 2 models, preserving the RuneScape format.

### Credits
* Displee (https://github.com/Displee): for the cache library.

* Gagravarr (https://github.com/Gagravarr): vorbis-java libraries.
* FormDev Software: for the FlatLaf interface look and feel.
* RuneLite Contributors (https://github.com/runelite/runelite): for the open source Old School RuneScape Client.
* Suic (https://github.com/Suicolen): For the simple JFX model viewer/editor tool.
* Jagex: for being an inspiration in making this happen.

### Known Bugs/Issues
* Cache Explorer: Not able to dump/export all files of single archive - only the first file is exported?
* Cache Explorer: Some caches may not load correctly
* Data Decoders: SoundFont conversion - may not be perfect
* Model Viewer: Textures do not work in RS2 caches
* Model Viewer: Textures may not load in all RSHD caches
* Model Viewer: May not work on Mac computers, a workaround would be running the project or jar directly through IntelliJ IDEA.

## That's all for now. Enjoy!
